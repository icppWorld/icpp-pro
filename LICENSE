                    ICPP-FREE LICENSE
                    Version 1, 29 April 2023

    Copyright (C) 2023 icppWorld <https://docs.icpp.world/>

The ICPP-FREE LICENSE allows you to use icpp-free at no cost. 

The intent of this license is to allow you to try out the capabilities, 
and hopefully you like it so much that you upgrade to the paid version, 
icpp-pro. 

Doing so will support our development team and it will benefit the 
larger community of Internet Computer C++ Smart Contract developers.

icpp-free is used to build WebAssembly canisters, and there are no
restrictions on use of the WebAssembly modules you create, except for 
the purpose of reverse engineering and modification of the ICPP software 
itself.

The free software version will alert you when a pro license is required,
and you can find summary at http://docs.icpp.world.

Thank you for your interest in our software, and any feedback on the
software or on this license can be emailed to icpp@icpp.world.
